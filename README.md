I created my personal portfolio <a href="https://www.shoshaikh.com/" target="_blank">shoshaikh.com</a> to showcase some of my projects I've worked on in the past, as well as to show some of my technical skills.<br/>
<br>
My portfolio was built using only using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. This was also my first time learning how to use HTML Canvas, and adding animations using only Vanilla JS.
